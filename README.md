# FixIt

This app is a fork of the [sample Xcode project PhotoScroller][PhotoScroller]:

"'PhotoScroller' demonstrates the use of embedded UIScrollViews and CATiledLayer
to create a rich user experience for displaying and paginating photos that can
be individually panned and zoomed. CATiledLayer is used to increase the
performance of paging, panning, and zooming with high-resolution images or large
sets of photos."
